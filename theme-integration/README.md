# Theme Integrations

The Ghost Like Button service ships without bundled theme assets. For a ready-to-use example, see the companion Pastiche theme:

- **Pastiche (Slack-inspired Ghost theme):** https://github.com/ifrederico/pastiche

That repository includes the `like-button` web component, CSS, theme toggle, and updated templates. Copy its approach into your own theme or fork it directly.
